## HTML DOCUMENTATION

  - ### HTML
    
    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it basically
    describes the structure of a web page, how the page is going to
    look, details inside the page , it’s appearance. It is not a
    programming language, rather it is a markup language, as there is no
    logical coding required. The word hypertext means linking one web
    page with another webpage. Html has many tags such as
    
    ``` 
     <p>, <h1>,<div>
    ```
    
    and many more by which one can define a structure of their webpage.
    Html is not a case sensitive language so the tags
    
    ``` 
     <H1> & <h1> 
    ```
    
    works in a similar way. Let us discuss a HTML tag: \<p\> This is
    Deepansh Agrawal’s documentation on HTML. \</p\> So the output will
    be:

    Every tag contains an opening and a closing part. Some of the tags
    do not require both opening and closing tags such as \</br\> which
    can be used to break a new line.
