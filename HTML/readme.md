## HTML DOCUMENTATION

  - ### HTML
    
    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it basically
    describes the structure of a web page, how the page is going to
    look, details inside the page , it’s appearance. It is not a
    programming language, rather it is a markup language, as there is no
    logical coding required. The word hypertext means linking one web
    page with another webpage. Html has many tags such as \<p\>,
    \<h1\>,\<div\> and many more by which one can define a structure of
    their webpage. Html is not a case sensitive language so the tags
    \<H1\> & \<h1\> works in a similar way.  
    Let us discuss a HTML tag: \<p\> This is Deepansh Agrawal’s
    documentation on HTML. \</p\> So the output will be:

    Every tag contains an opening and a closing part. Some of the tags
    do not require both opening and closing tags such as \</br\> which
    can be used to break a new line.

  - ### EXTENSION (.html / .html)
    
    The extension of html files is ".html" or ".htm". Since older
    versions of Windows only used three letters for an extension, this
    is why .htm but the newer browser accepts .html-based versions also.
    So, broadly speaking, the extension tells the browser that the file
    is an html file.

  - ### STRUTURE OF HTML
    
    We can understand HTML’s web page structure using a tree data
    structure. Every tree has a root node, then it has 2 child nodes
    i.e. Left child node and right child node. Then each child of the
    root also has 2 child nodes and this structure continues. So in the
    case of HTML we can describe html as a root node and it has 2 child
    nodes which are the head and the body section. Then the head section
    also has child nodes such as title, links, scrips and many more.
    Similarly the body section also has child nodes such as script,
    image,p, div, ect. The structure of the webpage defines the flow of
    tags in which the web page will appear.  
    Below is a visual representation of html as a tree data structure.
