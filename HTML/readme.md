<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it basically describes the structure of a web page, how the page is going to look, details inside the page , it’s appearance. 
It is not a programming language, rather it is a markup language, as there is no logical coding required. The word hypertext means linking one web page with another webpage.
Html has many tags such as<xmp> <p>, <h1>,<div>,</xmp> etc by which one can define a structure of their webpage. Html is not a case sensitive language so the tags<xmp> <H1> & <h1> </xmp>works in a similar way.
Let us discuss a HTML tag:
<p> This is Deepansh Agrawal’s documentation on HTML </p>
So the output will be “This is Deepansh Agrawal’s documentation on HTML”.
Every tag contains an opening and a closing part. Some of the tags do not require both opening and closing tags such as </br> which can be used to break a new line.
