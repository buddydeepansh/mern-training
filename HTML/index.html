            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>
                HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it basically describes the structure of a web page, how
                the page is going to look, details inside the page , it’s appearance.
                It is not a programming language, rather it is a markup language, as there is no logical coding
                required. The word hypertext means linking one web page with another webpage.
                Html has many tags such as &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;,&lt;div&gt; and many more by which one can define a
                structure of their
                webpage. Html is not a case sensitive language so the tags
                &lt;H1&gt; & &lt;h1&gt; works in a similar way.
                <br>
                Let us discuss a HTML tag:
                &lt;p&gt; This is Deepansh Agrawal’s documentation on HTML. &lt;/p&gt;
                So the output will be:
            <p> This is Deepansh Agrawal’s documentation on HTML.</p>
            Every tag contains an opening and a closing part. Some of the tags do not require both opening and closing
            tags such as &lt;/br&gt; which can be used to break a new line.

            <h3>EXTENSION (.html / .html)</h3>
            <p>
                The extension of html files is ".html" or ".htm". Since older versions of Windows only used three
                letters for an extension, this is why .htm but the newer browser accepts .html-based versions also. So,
                broadly speaking, the extension tells the browser that the file is an html file.

            <h3>STRUTURE OF HTML</h3>
            <p>
                We can understand HTML’s web page structure using a tree data structure.
                Every tree has a root node, then it has 2 child nodes i.e. Left child node and right child node. Then
                each child of the root also has 2 child nodes and this structure continues. So in the case of HTML we
                can describe html as a root node and it has 2 child nodes which are the head and the body section. Then
                the head section also has child nodes such as title, links, scrips and many more. Similarly the body
                section also has child nodes such as script, image,p, div, ect.
                The structure of the webpage defines the flow of tags in which the web page will appear.
                <br>
