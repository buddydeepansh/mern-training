                HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it basically describes the structure of a web page, how
                the page is going to look, details inside the page , it’s appearance.
                It is not a programming language, rather it is a markup language, as there is no logical coding
                required. The word hypertext means linking one web page with another webpage.
                Html has many tags such as &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;,&lt;div&gt; and many more by which one can define a structure of their
            webpage. Html is not a case sensitive language so the tags
             &lt;H1&gt; & &lt;h1&gt; works in a similar way.

            Let us discuss a HTML tag:
            &lt;p&gt; This is Deepansh Agrawal’s documentation on HTML. &lt;/p&gt;
            So the output will be:
            <p> This is Deepansh Agrawal’s documentation on HTML.</p>
            Every tag contains an opening and a closing part. Some of the tags do not require both opening and closing
            tags such as &lt;/br&gt; which can be used to break a new line.

    </ul>
