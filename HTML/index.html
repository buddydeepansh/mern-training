            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>
                HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it basically describes the structure of a web page, how
                the page is going to look, details inside the page , it’s appearance.
                It is not a programming language, rather it is a markup language, as there is no logical coding
                required. The word hypertext means linking one web page with another webpage.
                Html has many tags such as &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;,&lt;div&gt; and many more by which one can define a
                structure of their
                webpage. Html is not a case sensitive language so the tags
                &lt;H1&gt; & &lt;h1&gt; works in a similar way.
                <br>
                Let us discuss a HTML tag:
                &lt;p&gt; This is Deepansh Agrawal’s documentation on HTML. &lt;/p&gt;
                So the output will be:
            <p> This is Deepansh Agrawal’s documentation on HTML.</p>
            Every tag contains an opening and a closing part. Some of the tags do not require both opening and closing
            tags such as &lt;/br&gt; which can be used to break a new line.

            </p>

            <h3>EXTENSION (.html / .html)</h3>
            <p>
                The extension of html files is ".html" or ".htm". Since older versions of Windows only used three
                letters for an extension, this is why .htm but the newer browser accepts .html-based versions also. So,
                broadly speaking, the extension tells the browser that the file is an html file.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>STRUTURE OF HTML</h3>
            <p>
                We can understand HTML’s web page structure using a tree data structure.
                Every tree has a root node, then it has 2 child nodes i.e. Left child node and right child node. Then
                each child of the root also has 2 child nodes and this structure continues. So in the case of HTML we
                can describe html as a root node and it has 2 child nodes which are the head and the body section. Then
                the head section also has child nodes such as title, links, scrips and many more. Similarly the body
                section also has child nodes such as script, image,p, div, ect.
                The structure of the webpage defines the flow of tags in which the web page will appear.
                <br>
                Below is a visual representation of html as a tree data structure.

            <h3>COMPILER, INTERPRETER & HTMLPARSER</h3>
            <p>
                A compiler takes the entire program in one go. It generates an intermediate machine code. It is best
                suited for the production environment. The compiler used by programming languages such as C,C++, java,
                etc. It generates errors on compile time only. <br>
                Whereas an interpreter takes a single line of code at a time. It never produces an intermediate machine
                code. It is best suited for a software development environment. It is used by languages such as python,
                perl, ruby, etc <br>
                Parser or we can use HTMLParser for html. Parsing means analyzing and converting a program into an
                internal format that a runtime environment can actually run.
                Initially when we open a html file in a browser, it converts the stream of characters into tokens and
                this process is called tokenization. Then after tokenization, nodes are created from the tokens. These
                nodes are then converted into a DOM i.e. document object model as a tree structure.
                <br>

            <h3>DEVELOPER TOOLS</h3>
            <p>
                So, basically developer tools are the modern tools provided by the web browser which are being used by
                the developer to test, debug, view source code of their website. The main task of developer tools can be
                that a person can open the developer tools and scroll to a particular section of a web page and there
                they can test, debug or change their design. <br>
                Similarly dev tools are being used to understand the structure of a web page or how the elements are
                being aligned over one another. We can use developer tools in almost all browsers. In google chrome we
                can enter developer tools section either by right click -> inspect, or by the shortcut key : Ctrl +
                Shift + I. <br>
                As developer tools we can also view the source code of any webpage by right click -> view source. In
                this way if we are not a developer of that webpage, then we can see the source code as how the developer
                has designed the page.

            <h3>HTML TAGS / ELEMENTS</h3>
            <p>So there are many many tags in html which have separate roles or work to do. For example an <image> tag
                will let you add an image to your webpage or an <a> tag which is an anchor tag allows you to add
                    links to your webpage.
                    Let us take a tag and understand it’s syntax:
                    &lt;p&gt; This is a paragraph tag. &lt;/p&gt;
                    There are 3 main parts: <br>
                    The opening tag: In case of an opening tag it consists of the tag within the angle brackets and
                    tells the browser that the particular rag is being started. In the above case &lt;p&gt; is the opening
                    tag. <br>
                    The closing tag: In case of a closing tag,it tells the browser that the following tag is now
                    being closed and it is also between angle braces.
                    In the above example &lt;/p&gt; acts as a closing paragraph tag. <br>
                    The content: The content refers to the data which you are writing between the opening and
                    closing tags.
                    In the above example “This is a paragraph tag.” is the content.
                </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <h3> &lt;h&gt; ELEMENT </h3>
                <p>
                    The heading element refers to the heading of a paragraph or text written in big/bold letters. Heading is
                    used to highlight important topics. Search engines use headings for indexing and structuring the content
                of a web page.
                There are 6 types of heading section elements from
                The heading element refers to the heading of a paragraph or text written in big/bold letters. Heading is
                used to highlight important topics. Search engines use headings for indexing and structuring the content
                of a web page.
                There are 6 types of heading section elements from
                &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;, as &lt;h1&gt; being the largest and boldest and moving towards &lt;h6&gt;
                smallest.
                Ex: <h2> This is a type of h2 heading. </h2>
                
                
            </p>
        </li>
    -->
        <br>
        <li>
            <h3>ANCHOR &lt;a&gt; ELEMENT </h3>
            <p>
                The anchor element is used to either create a hyperlink of other websites or create a hyperlink to mail
                or phone. It also has both opening and closing tags so the content between the &lt;a&gt; & &lt;/a&gt; can be
                displayed as a link and whenever a cursor points towards the links the user can redirect to the
                particular link or mail or phone.
                The anchor tag generally contains a href attribute in which we provide the link where we want to
                redirect the user if they click on it. The new link can open in the same tab or new tab/window depending
                upon the value of the target attribute. <br>
                Ex:
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a">
